Hi There, 
We will begin the Computer Architecture Next Gen CA course 
This is for your revision.

Chapter-1: Introduction 
CPU - Processor, Memory - RAM;Secondary storage, Input Device, Output Device
Von Neumann Architecture

Take the data from memory to CPU, perform the operation, and then write back to the memory
Von Neumann Arch

Secondary Memory -> Main Memory -> Cache Memory
Most follow Von Neumann Arch

Memory Unit: 
Cache Memory - On chip memory
32MB cache, multiple levels of cache with (max 64MB)

Registers: Very fast memory unit

Chip Designing:
Transistor -> Combinational Circuit -> Gates are designed from transistors

Moore's Lab - No of transistors in a chip double every 2 years
Density also increases, chip becomes smaller

Basic Layout of Computer:

Computer: 1. CPU, 2. Memory, 3. I/O, 4. Interconnects

CPU: Register, ALU, Control Unit, Internal CPU interconnect
Add/Subtract/Compare: All done in ALU
Before the operation, they need to be there in register
From register it goes to ALU to perform the operation

Memory: Cache Memory (part of CPU), Main Memory, Secondary Memory

Operations of a computer: 

1. Computer cannot do anything without giving instructions
2. It is a set of commands a user is giving, computer is following the commands
3. Assembly language depends on the ISA

Memory operations:
1. Data must be loaded from memory to registers before operation

_______________
   600         | r
   300         | c
   200         | b
   100         | a
_______________
   12000 ,- base address

asm (MIPS): r = a+b+c

lw $2, 0($1) - 0+ 12000: go to 12000, fetch the value (100), store in register 2
lw $3, 4($1) - 4 + 12000: 
add $2, $2, $3 - Add the content of reg 2 and 3, store in 2
lw $3, 8($1) - 8+12000: 
add $2 $2 $3 - Add value 2 and 3, store in 2
sw $2, 20($1) - 20+12000: 

You also need to load the base address in the register
Store the data from the register back to the main memory
Even the set of instructions are also in memory
